# Matrix-solver-and-linear-algebra-stuff
anything related to matrices, vectors and planes, and linear algebra operations
//more stuff will be added about (1) sparse matrices (2) lines and planes///
 In this project, I provided you with the source code for a matrix solver that provides 6 operations for now, but I will add more as I learn more. the provided operations are
(1) matrix addition and subtraction 
(2) scalar multiplication 
(3) matrix multiplication 
(4) matrix transpose 
(5) matrix inverse 
(6) matrix determinant.
