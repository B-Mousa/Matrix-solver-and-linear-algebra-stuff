# Matrix-solver-and-linear-algebra-stuff
any thing related to matrices, vectors and planes, and linear algebra stuff
//more stuff will be added about (1) sparse matrices (2) lines and planes///
 In this project, I provided you with the source code for a matrix solver that provides 6 operations for now but I will add more as I learn more. the options are
(1) matrix addition and subtraction 
(2) scalar multiplication 
(3) matrix multiplication 
(4) matrix transpose 
(5) matrix inverse 
(6) matrix determinant.
 You can follow along and learn as well and I really encourage you to practice as much as possible because this is the way to learn how to program. This is my first project ever and I know it could be better but I don't have time before the carer fair so I was forced to wrap it up the way I did.
